        <p>
          Naming in programming is an art that dictates your codebases
          efficiency, readability, and scalability. In this section I detail
          lessons learned regarding naming conventions in production ready
          codebases. The reference material is:

          by author: Robert C. Martin. I make my own examples and use my own
          higher level interpretations in this blog
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Names should be
            <a class="link" href="#Self-describing"
              >descriptive and should reveal intention and usage
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Similar names should have
            <a class="link" href="#differences">
              notable and tangible differences
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Names should be
            <a class="link" href="#searchable"> conversable and searchable </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The following convention for verbs and nouns:
            <a class="link" href="#classes-function"
              >Classes should have noun names, methods/functions should be
              verbs.</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Self-describing" class="heading">Self descriptive</h3>
        <p>
          variable names should reveal the purpose of the assigned variable.
          Having ambiguos naming conventions can complicate even the simplist of
          code. In a sense, poorly named variables is a form of involuntary
          obfuscation. Lets see some basic examples.
        </p>
        <div>
          <div class="code">
            <h4 class="code-text">
              <b><u>Poor naming</u></b>
            </h4>
            <code class="code-text">
              int x = 10:
              <span class="code-comment"
                >// what is x, why is it initialized with 10?
              </span>
              <br />
              int[] list = new int[x];
              <span class="code-comment"
                >What is the list supposed to represent?
              </span>
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
        with just these two lines of code, it is already unclear what these
        variables do without code context, an effort that should would not be
        expended by simply naming variables meaningfully.
        <div class="mt-2">
          <div class="code">
            <h4 class="code-text">
              <b><u>Good naming</u></b>
            </h4>
            <code class="code-text">
              int MAX_NUMBER_OF_TEST_RETAKES = 10 :
              <span class="code-comment"
                >// we now know this is a constant that represents a limit on
                test retakes
              </span>
              <br />
              int[] studentRetakeScores = new int[MAX_NUMBER_OF_TEST_RETAKES];
              <span class="code-comment"
                >// we now know this is a list of scores from a test, with a
                limit on retakes.
              </span>
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
        Here is a another example, where poor naming creates an extra layer of
        complexity to otherwise simple code
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            <pre>
<span class="code-comment" > //Non descriptive code </span>
private int calc( int a, int b){ <span class="code-comment" > //what does this function do? What do the parameters represent? </span>
    int c = helper(a,b);  <span class="code-comment" > //what is this function call? </span>
    int d = c/2;  <span class="code-comment" > //why are we dividing by two?</span>
    return d;  <span class="code-comment" > //What is this result?</span>
}

<span class="code-comment"> //descriptive code </span>
private int calculateAreOfTriangle(int base, int height){
    int  productOfSides =  multiplyTriangleSides(base, height);
    int area = productOfSides / 2;
    return area;
}
</pre>
          </code>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="differences">
        <h3 class="heading">Meaningful differences</h3>
        <p>
          If you makes name only slightly different to satisfy a compiler (in
          essence re-using a variable name with slight alteration), this can
          cause headaches. A common case is to add redundant "noise" words,
          which add no context and merely allow compilation by making names
          slightly differ. Examples of bad naming include:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            String name; <span class="code-comment"> </span> <br />
            String namE;
            <span class="code-comment"
              >//How hard would this difference be to find in production? It's
              much too similar!
            </span>
            <br />
            or <br />
            void getProduct(); <br />
            void getProducts(); <br />
            void getTheProducts(); <br />
            <span class="code-comment"
              >//What function do you even use when you want to get a product?
              Even in an IDE this is barely useable</span
            ><br />
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          Here, the reasoning is clear, its hard to find errors, to understand
          the use case of each function/variable and most of all, hard to read
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="searchable">
        <h3 class="heading">Conversable and searchable</h3>
        <h4 class="">Converisble</h4>
        <p>
          Code should be easy to <i>talk about</i>. This is imperative when
          discussing sections of code with other programmers. It allows for
          understandable conversation.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            char[] abc = {'a', ..., 'z'}; <br />
            vs <br />
            String alphabetCharacters = {'a', ..., 'z'}; <br />
            <span class="code-comment"
              >While the code may be understandable, the second naming is much
              easier to <i>talk about</i> i'd also wager it's easier to
              <i>think about.</i></span
            >
            <br />
            <span class="code-comment">
              "Hey can we look at the abc for ....?" vs "Hey can we look at the
              alphabetCharacters for ....?"</span
            >
          </code>
        </div>

        <h4 class="">Searchable</h4>
        <p>
          Code should be easy to <i>search</i>. This is important for
          developmental practices. When working, you could easily search a file
          for
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text"> char[] alphabetCharacters = ...; </code>
        </div>
        vs
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text"> char[] a= ...; </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is because "a" alone is extremely common and would likely lead to
          hundreds of hits, vs a single hit for a unique-searchable-name.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="classes-function">
        <h3 class="heading">Classes and methods</h3>
        <h4 class="">Classes</h4>
        <p>
          Classes are representitive of real life objects, thus, it only makes
          sense to name them as you would in real life: as a noun! You wouldn't
          call a car "getCar" or "setCar". It's actually quite hard to naturally
          stray from this convention, but its still worth noting.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            class Car{ ... }
            <span class="code-comment"
              >// Great, we know this creates car objects. or at the least is a
              base class.</span
            >
          </code>
        </div>
        vs
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            class getCar { ... }
            <span class="code-comment"> // This sounds like an action!</span>
          </code>
        </div>

        <h4 class="">Methods</h4>
        <p>
          Since methods are <i>actions</i> they should be named like any other
          action: as a verb! getPages vs pages, one is a clear action, the other
          would be confused an object!
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            private Page pages(){ ... }
            <span class="code-comment">
              // What task is being performed? Is this a method?</span
            >
          </code>
        </div>
        vs
        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            private Page getpages(){ ... }
            <span class="code-comment">
              // Good, we're returning some pages!</span
            >
