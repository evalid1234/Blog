      <section>
        <h2 id="classes" class="heading">Classes</h2>
        <p>
          Classes are the blueprints that represent real world objects. Any noun
          you can think of can be represented as a class. Classes are integral
          since they allow for the rapid and consistent construction of
          "instances", which are the objects themselves. Classes can have
          properties/fields, these are things like names, height, color etc...
          basically inherent traits of an object or thing. They also have
          methods, these are the actions the object can do, like "bark" if the
          object is a dog, or "fly", if its a bird. Classes are powerful since
          one class can quickly produce instances of objects all in one class
          that is easily altered/extended (if loosely coupled).
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            public class Dog {
            <br /><span class="code-comment">//properties</span> <br />
            private String breed; <br /><span class="code-comment"
              >//methods</span
            >
            <br />public void bark(){ // woof } }
          </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Classes are constructed via a constructor which in Java is a method
          that is inherently provided if not defined. They have the same name as
          the class and are public since they need to be called by other classes
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text"> public Dog(String breed){ } </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice they have parameter options, which means users can pass
          arguments to the constructor for initialization
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            public Dog(String breed){ this.breed = breed; }
          </code>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="objects">
        <h2 class="heading">Objects</h2>

        <p>
          Objects are the instances of a class. If a class is a blueprint of a
          <i>thing</i> then an object <b>is</b> the thing. For example, in the
          dog class above, an object would could be a chihuahua named peter.
        </p>
        <p>
          objects are constructed using the class name and the "new" keyword
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            Dog peter = new Dog("chihuahua");
            <span class="code-comment">
              Notice the '()', this calls the constructor of the class</span
            >
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like that we have a dog variable named peter that has a breed of
          chihuahua. Now this is a pretty poorly built class, but the idea is
          there, classes are useful!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="encapsulation">
        <h2 class="heading">Encapsulation</h2>
        <p>
          Encapsulation is the art of grouping related data and methods into a
          class. Some like to refer to it as data hiding, since often you use
          access modifiers like "public", "private" etc.. to limit the scope of
          use. This is often paired with setters and getters to fine tune the
          access control of the data.
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            public Person {
            <br />private String name; <br />
            private int age; <br />public int getAge(); <br />public String
            getName(); <br />
            }
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          notice how, using these modifiers you can now only get the name and
          age property values via public methods and you <b>cannot</b> alter the
          data yourself outside the class!
        </p>
        <p>
          In a sense, a class dedicated to a single object is in itself an
          example of encapsulation since you are grouping related properties and
          actions to define a real life object.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="abstraction">
        <h2 class="heading">Abstraction</h2>
        <p>
          Abstraction is the hiding of minute details. Often, programmers don't
          need to know how something works, they care about the big picture. One
          example could be a car or bus. We do not care about every component of
          the car like the bolts used or wiring manufactures, we want the
          <i>car</i> and it's important function. Well then, what are important
          functions? In the case of the car, this could be: driving, honking,
          braking etc.. they are broadly defined actions that are made up of
          <i>many</i> individual and hidden components. A honk requires the use
          of many electronics, the registering of human input and much more, but
          in reality we do not care how this is handled in everyday use, we just
          want it to make the noise. This is commonly done by limiting the scope
          of internal code via the "private" keyword, and using public methods
          to retrieve the necessary code only.
        </p>

        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            public class Car {
            <br />private void flipHonkMultiplexer(){//} <br />
            <span class="code-comment">//other private methods</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            public void honk(){
            <br />
            flipHonkMultiplexer(); <br />
            <span class="code-comment">//other private honk internal code</span>
            <br />
            } <br />
            }
          </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          In the above, the user gets the honk noise via a single public honk()
          call, but they never interact with the private methods that, together,
          produce the honk noise. Just how we like it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="polymorphism">
        <h2 class="heading">Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>
          Polymorphism is the principle of having "many forms". There are many
          forms of polymorphism, overloading, overriding, type casting etc..
          this is typically done in compile or run-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          overloading is done in compile-time, this is often used in methods,
          but can also extend to operators.
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            public foo();
            <br />
            public foo(int bar); <br />
            public foo(String bar);
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice we have 3 public methods all with the same name, this is
          possible since the compiler differentiates based on the parameter
          list. This allows the foo method to define different behavior based on
          the arguments passed, essentially taking many forms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Run time polymorphism can also happen in many forms, it can be as
          simple as type casting, to passing generics and method overriding a
          superclass method
        </p>
        <p>Casting</p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text"> Dog puppy = new Shitzu(); </code>
        </p>
        <p>Casting</p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text"
            >double number = (double) 12;
            <span class="code-comment"
              >This would happen automatically but still a casting.</span
            >
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>Overriding</p>
        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            class Parent {
            <br />
            void Print() <br />}

            <br />
            // Class 2 <br />
            class subclass1 extends Parent { <br />void Print(){ //print 1 }
            <br />
            } <br />class subclass2 extends Parent { <br />
            void Print() { // Print 2 } }
            <br />
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we called the functions Print from both subclasses the print would
          be "1" and "2" respectively. Showing how overriding occurs.
        </p>

      <section id="inheritance">
        <h2 class="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          Classes can inherit properties and methods of another class, known as
          the "base" or "super" class. This allows for swift code extension and
          reuse, without the need for more typing. Classes and interfaces
          inherit using the "extends" keyword.
        </p>

        <p class="code">
          <code class="code-text">
            public class Dog{//properties and methods}
            <br />
            public class Chihuahua extends Dog{ <br />
            //all dog code <br />
            public customChihuhuaFeature();
            <br />
            }
          </code>
